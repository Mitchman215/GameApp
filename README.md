# GameApp
An iOS app for a few basic games like Concentration, Set, Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Chess. Created for practice coding in Swift using SwiftUI

Currently only has Concentration and Set implemented with guidance from Stanford's iOS App development course (CS193p 2021 Spring version).

Future plans exist for adding new games, multiplayer functionality, and AI to play against.
